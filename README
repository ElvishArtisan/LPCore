This is the README file for the LPCore package.

LPCore is a server and application control framework for the line of audio
engine products manufactured by Logitek Audio Systems
[http://logitekaudio.com/], written for Linux.  It contains the following
components:

1) lpcored Daemon
The message passing and control daemon.  It manages control messages between
audio engines (LP1 protocol via RS-232C serial links) and external
applications (LP2 protocol via TCP/IP links) and replaces the
'Supervisor' application supplied by Logitek.

2) LP Application Framework
A library for interacting with one or more audio engines via lpcored(8).

3) LPCore Monitor
A GUI applet for montioring and originating LP2 messages.

4) Sample Applications
An 'application' in LPCore is a program that can be used to implement the
kind of functionality provided by the 'Command Builder' application supplied
by Logitek.  The following sample applications are provided:

  LPAutoCue -- Automatic cue channel muting when a fader is turned on.
