                         LPCore Metadata Commands

In addition to the standard LP1/LP2 protocol commands, LPCore
uses metadata commands to control aspects of the connection between
clients and lpcored(8).  Thes commands are 'private' in that they are
neither understood nor passed on to the AE engines.

The format is the same as that used for standard LP1/LP2 with the exception
of the first byte, which is a 0x04 instead of 0x02.

0x01 - SET CONNECTION CONTEXT

 1    0x04       Metadata Header
 2    0x02       Length
 3    0x01       Command Byte - Set Connection Context
 4    <context>

where <context> can be:

      0x00 - 'Isolated' context: the connection receives updates from
             engines, but not from changes made by other LP2 clients.
             This is the default.

      0x01 - 'Global' context: the connection receives updates from
             changes made by other LP2 clients as well as changes from
	     engines.


0x02 - SEND FULL STATE

 1    0x04       Metadata Header
 2    0x01       Length
 3    0x02       Command Byte - Send Full State


0x03 - CONNECTION PING

 1    0x04       Metadata Header
 2    0x01       Length
 3    0x03       Command Byte - Connection Ping

lpcored(8) will echo back the exact same message.
