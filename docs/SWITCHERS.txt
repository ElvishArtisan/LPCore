                  Switcher Application Notes for LPCore

The following devices are supported as switchers under LPCore:

360 Systems AM-16/B Audio Crosspoint Switcher
Broadcast Tools SS 8.2 Dual Stereo Audio Switcher
Telos Zephyr Classic Digital Network Audio Tranceiver
Telos Zephyr Xtreme Digital Network Audio Tranceiver

See the sections below for notes on each specific model.

360 SYSTEMS AM-16/B AUDIO CROSSPOINT SWITCHER

Type ID: 1

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of MIDI connections to the 'MIDI IN' and
'MIDI OUT' ports on the back of the unit, with the appropriate MIDI device
specified in the LPSwitcher::open() call.  The following settings should be
configured on the AM-16/B:

       Control Port Type: MIDI (jumper JMP1)
       Program Send: OFF
       Receive Channel: o (Omni mode, center display in Receive Channel 
                           Mode)
       Unit Address: 1 (Right display in Receive Channel mode)
       Memory Protect: OFF

The driver uses MIDI programs '0' and '1' on the AM-16/B when processing
crosspoint changes; anything previously saved in those programs will
be overwritten!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadcast Tools SS 8.2 Dual Stereo Audio Switcher

Type ID: 0

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to a four pin RJ11
modular jack on the back of the unit (an adapter to a standard DB9
connector is supplied by Broadcast Tools with the unit).  Serial port
speed on the SS 8.2 should be set to 19200 (some have found 9600 to work
instead).  Do *not* use 38400, as there are known bugs within the SS 8.2
when used with this speed!  Serial port parameters should be set to
19200 baud rate (or 9600 if that worked instead), No parity, 8 data
bits, 1 stop bit.

Internal switch settings should be as follows:

 SW14-1: OFF   ID = 0
 SW14-2: OFF
 SW14-3: OFF
 SW14-4: OFF   Interlock Mode
 SW14-5: ON
 SW14-6: OFF   Output Port Control
 SW14-7: OFF   N/A
 SW14-8: OFF   Pulse Stretcher OFF
 SW14-9: OFF   Alternate Mode OFF
SW14-10: See below

If you wish to use GPI (referred to as 'PIP', for 'Parallel Input Port'
in the Broadcast Tools documentation), then you will also need to be sure
that DIP switch SW-14-10 is ON, whereas leaving it OFF allows crosspoints
to be selected by means of closures at these inputs.

GPIO Driver-Driven General Purpose Input/Output Cards

Type ID: 4

GENERAL NOTES:
Cards supported by the 'gpio' kernel driver package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Telos Zephyr Classic Digital Network Audio Tranceiver

Type ID: 2

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the 'RS232 REMOTE'
connector on the back of the unit (three wire, null modem).  Default 
serial port speed on the Zephyr is 9600.  Serial port parameters should
be set to no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Telos Zephyr Xtreme Digital Network Audio Tranceiver

Type ID: 3

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the 'RS232 REMOTE'
connector on the back of the unit (three wire, null modem) or by
TCP/IP connection.  Default serial port speed on the Zephyr is 9600.
Serial port parameters should be set to no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit.
